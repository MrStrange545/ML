# My AIM: ML engineer

## What exactly I want to do with ML?
- I want to create models, that will learn from data the same tasks that a human would learn.
- Then I will combine them with Hardware to make robots basically.
- Then I will use these models to work for me.
- I will work on them, to improve and enhance them.

## What is Machine Learning?
- ML enables machines to learn from data and improve their performance on a task over time.
- The output of ML is a trained model that can make predictions, classify objects, or make decisions.

## Why I choose it?
- ML can automate repetitive or time-consuming tasks.
- ML models can make predictions or decisions based on patterns in data, reducing the likelihood of human error.
- ML models can be easily replicated and deployed across multiple systems or locations.

## Areas in ML
- **Supervised Learning**: Training models on labeled data to predict outcomes
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Discovering patterns and relationships in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Training models to make decisions through trial and error
- **Deep Learning**: Using neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex representations
- **Natural Language Processing**: Enabling computers to understand, generate, and process human language
- **Computer Vision**: Developing algorithms to interpret and understand visual data from images and videos
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzing and forecasting data with temporal dependencies
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in data
- **Robotics**: Using ML to control and navigate robots in various environments
- **Generative Models**: Creating new data samples that resemble existing data
